Project Overview

Financial fraud is becoming increasingly sophisticated in modern digital ecosystems. Traditional fraud detection methods often fail to provide transparent and explainable decisions.

This project integrates:

- Artificial Intelligence (Rule-Based Decision Logic)
- Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP)
- Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)
- Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality (ELECTRE)

to deliver accurate, explainable, and scalable fraud detection.

---

Objectives

- Detect suspicious transactions in real time
- Reduce false positives through multi-criteria evaluation
- Provide explainable fraud risk assessment
- Recommend effective fraud prevention strategies
- Support future integration with Machine Learning models
